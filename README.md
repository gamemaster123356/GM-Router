## ðŸ“˜ Usage
1. Import the GM-Router library into your PHP file:
```php
include('PATH TO THE FOLDER WHERE gm-router.php IS STORED');
```

2. Create an instance of GMRouter class:
```php
$gmrouter = new GMRouter();
```

3. Configure your routes:
```php
$gmrouter->addRoute('GET', '/home', 'controller', 'HomeController@index');
$gmrouter->addRoute('POST', '/login', 'controller', 'AuthController@login');
```

3. Run the router to dispatch the appropriate route handler(NOTE: This line SHOULD be added AFTER adding all your routes):
```php
$gmrouter->dispatch();
```
