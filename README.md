# GM Router
A flexible and intuitive PHP router for handling routing and middleware in web applications.

<br>

## ðŸŒŸ Features
- **Routing:** The router allows you to define routes by specifying the HTTP method(s), URI pattern, and the handler function or controller to be executed when a match is found.

- **Dynamic Route Parameters with Regex Support:** The GMRouter class allows for the definition of dynamic route parameters with regex support. This feature enhances routing by enabling custom constraints on parameter values within URI patterns.

- **Route Groups:** The router supports route grouping, allowing you to apply common middleware or prefix to a group of routes.

- **Named Routes:** You can assign names to routes, making it easier to generate URLs for specific routes.

- **Middleware:** You can attach middleware functions to routes or route groups. Middleware functions are executed before the route handler and can perform tasks such as authentication, authorization, input validation, etc.

- **Middleware Grouping:** This enables you to group and apply multiple middleware functions together, simplifying the application of shared logic to specific sets of routes or route groups. This feature enhances code reusability and maintainability by providing an organized approach to managing middleware stacks.

- **Redirects:** The router provides a method to define route redirects, which redirect requests from one URI to another.

- **Error Handling:** The router allows you to define error handlers for different HTTP status codes. You can specify either a callback function or a file path to handle the errors.

- **Customizable:** The router supports various options such as specifying the directory for controller classes, middleware classes, CSRF token expiration time, and allowed referers for CSRF protection.

- **CSRF Protection:** The router includes CSRF token handling and validation to protect against cross-site request forgery attacks.

- **Dynamic Controller Resolution:** The router can resolve controller handlers in the format "Controller@method" to actual callable functions.

## ðŸ“˜ Usage
1. Import the GM-Router library into your PHP file:
```php
include('PATH TO THE FOLDER WHERE gm-router.php IS STORED');
```

2. Create an instance of GMRouter class:
```php
$gmrouter = new GMRouter();
```

3. Configure your routes:
```php
$gmrouter->addRoute('GET', '/home', 'controller', 'HomeController@index');
$gmrouter->addRoute('POST', '/login', 'controller', 'AuthController@login');
```

3. Run the router to dispatch the appropriate route handler(NOTE: This line SHOULD be added AFTER adding all your routes):
```php
$gmrouter->dispatch();
```
